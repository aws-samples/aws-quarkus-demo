# Quarkus example project for AWS Lambda

This example project demonstrates how Quarkus can be used to implement lightweight Java-based applications using AWS Lambda.
In this documentation, we'll cover how to

* Compile the application to a native executable
* Packaging of the application in a Custom Runtime for AWS Lambda
* Set up the infrastructure using [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html)

The infrastructure is set up using AWS SAM and implemented with YAML.

## Application architecture

The architecture of the application is pretty simple and consists of a few classes that implement a REST-service that stores all information in an Amazon DynamoDB-table. Quarkus offers an [extension](https://quarkus.io/guides/dynamodb) for Amazon DynamoDB that is based  on AWS SDK for Java V2. The Quarkus extension supports two programming models:

* Blocking access
* Asynchronous programming


## Compile the Java application

Compiling the application to an Uber-JAR is very straight forward:

```shell script
./mvnw clean package
```

## Native Image build

Native image requires the addition of SSL related dependencies to the `function.zip`. Please refer to the [Quarkus documentation](https://quarkus.io/guides/amazon-lambda#additional-requirements-for-client-ssl) for more details. This sample project contains an exec-maven-plugin configuration that extracts the files from the Docker image and copies them to the target folder.

To compile the application to a native binary and generate the `function.zip` use the below command.
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, run the native executable build in a container using:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dnative-image.docker-build=true
```

## Testing with SAM local

Modify the DynamoDB configuration as below, and startup DynamoDB-local.

Launch the local API, which should startup on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
```shell script
sam local start-api --template sam.jvm.yaml 
```

You should see the following output:

```
Mounting LambdaQuarkusFunction at http://127.0.0.1:3000/users [GET, POST]
Mounting LambdaQuarkusFunction at http://127.0.0.1:3000/users/{userId} [DELETE, GET]
You can now browse to the above endpoints to invoke your functions. You do not need to restart/reload SAM CLI while working on your functions, changes will be reflected instantly/automatically. You only need to restart SAM CLI if you update your AWS SAM template
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:3000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

After the resources have been created successfully, you can start testing. First we want to create a user:

```shell script
curl -v -d '{"userName":"jdoe", "firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe", "age":"35"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST  http://127.0.0.1:3000/users
```

Logging to the active SAM local API will appear:

```

```


Now we can list all users that we have created:

```shell script
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:3000/users
```

The output should be like:

```
[{"userId":"a700af5b-af80-4a6d-acfd-a9881568ebdd","userName":"jdoe","firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","age":35},{"userId":"77492694-cdec-40a0-a27f-38173960c8e0","userName":"jdoe","firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","age":35}]
```

### DynamoDB Local
[DynamoDB Local](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html) is also supported: 
The downloadable version of DynamoDB lets you write and test applications without accessing the DynamoDB web service. Instead, the database is self-contained on your computer. When you're ready to  deploy your application in production, you can make a few minor changes to the code so that it uses the DynamoDB web service.

Simply run the below command to execute DynamoDB locally.

```shell script
docker run -p 8000:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local  -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -inMemory -sharedDb
```

To create a table execute:

```shell script
aws dynamodb create-table --table-name Users --attribute-definitions AttributeName=userId,AttributeType=S --key-schema AttributeName=userId,KeyType=HASH --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
```

Update the `application.properties` to use the local DynamoDB

```
quarkus.dynamodb.endpoint-override=http://localhost:8000

quarkus.dynamodb.aws.region=eu-central-1
quarkus.dynamodb.aws.credentials.type=static
quarkus.dynamodb.aws.credentials.static-provider.access-key-id=test-key
quarkus.dynamodb.aws.credentials.static-provider.secret-access-key=test-secret
```

Please note in case you see connection refused errors that you may need to replace localhost with your local hostname (or create a docker bridge network) depending on your configuration.

Where:
```
quarkus.dynamodb.endpoint-override - Override the DynamoDB client to use a local instance instead of an AWS service
quarkus.dynamodb.aws.region - It’s required by the client, but since you’re using a local DynamoDB instance you can pick any valid AWS region.
quarkus.dynamodb.aws.credentials.type - Set static credentials provider with any values for access-key-id and secret-access-key
```

## AWS Deployment: Setting up the infrastructure and deploying the application using AWS SAM

After we've built the AWS Lambda function (native-image or JVM-based), we need to package our application and deploy it. The SAM package command creates a zip of your code and dependencies and uploads it to S3. SAM deploy creates a Cloudformation Stack and deploys your resources.

The following commands package and deploy the JVM-based version of the application.

```shell script
sam package --template-file sam.jvm.yaml --output-template-file output.yaml --s3-bucket <your_s3_bucket>

sam deploy --template-file output.yaml --stack-name APIGatewayQuarkusDemo --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

If you want to deploy the native version of the application, you have to use a different SAM template.

```shell script
sam package --template-file sam.native.yaml --output-template-file output.native.yaml --s3-bucket <your_s3_bucket>

sam deploy --template-file output.native.yaml --stack-name APIGatewayQuarkusDemo --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

During deployment, the CloudFormation template creates the AWS Lambda function, an Amazon DynamoDB table, an Amazon API Gateway REST-API, and all necessary IAM roles.

## Testing with AWS

After the resources has been created successfully, you can start testing. 

### Local Testing using SAM Local

The AWS SAM CLI allows you to run your Lambda functions locally on your laptop in a simulated Lambda environment. This requires docker to be installed. 
Run the following SAM CLI command to locally test your lambda function, passing the appropriate SAM template. The event parameter takes any JSON file, in this case the sample payload.json.

```shell script
sam local invoke --template target/sam.jvm.yaml --event payload.json
```

The native image can also be locally tested using the sam.native.yaml template:

```shell script
sam local invoke --template target/sam.native.yaml --event payload.json
```

### Testing the application in AWS

First we want to create a user:

```shell script
curl -v -d '{"userName":"jdoe", "firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe", "age":"35"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST  https://<your-api-gateway-url>/prod/users
```

Now we can list all users that we have created:

```shell script
curl -v https://<your-api-gateway-url>/prod/users
```

Of course we can get a specific user with the `userId`:

```shell script
curl -v -X GET 'https://<your-api-gateway-url>/prod/users?userId=<userId>'
```

If we want to delete the user that we've created recently, we only need to specify the `userId`:

```shell script
curl -v -X DELETE 'https://<your-api-gateway-url>/prod/users/<userId>'
```
